Banking System

Title: “XBanking”  
Problem: Banking can be hard. How do you let people access their accounts? What if they have multiple accounts? It can be hard to keep track. 
Primary Stakeholder: Any bank who needs to manage a lot of accounts 
Data structure: HashTable of Clients. Each Client may have multiple accounts. Hash function will be full name no spaces absolute value hashcode modulo 7(will need to be changed). Use quadratic probing to deal with collision.
